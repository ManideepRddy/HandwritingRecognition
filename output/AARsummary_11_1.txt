PALO ALTANS BEND COUNCIL EARS
MTM. VIEW HOPES TO LOWER VOLUME
on SHORELINE NOISE COMPLAINTS
It's unlikely that Mountain View we'll be able to
Completely eliminate runaway noise coming from Shoreline
amphitheater , but, action taken by the council this week
may bring the city a step closer to at least turning down
the volume .
That step may be enough to satisfy a group of
angry Palo alto residents who have been henting
otog about
the possibility of a lawsuit unless something is done
to keep concert noise of out of their neighborhoods .
" We want to exhaust every possibility ( before filing
Suit), said Palo alis City Manager Bell Zaner,
adding that he isn't sure that a lowsent would solve
the house problem .
Residents of northeast Palo alto formed the Abate
Shoreline amphitheater Noise Coalition in September
to protest noise bouncing into their neighborhoods from
the Concert Qena. Muse from concerts, they said,
Could be heard in their backyards , shaking their houses ,
disturbing their sleep and endangering their well- being.
