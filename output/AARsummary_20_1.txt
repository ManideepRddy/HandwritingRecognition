WINGING IT FOR
SCULPTURE
NOT EVERYONE notices , but something is missing
from the much-maligned wood sculpture at Waverley
Street and Embarcadero avenue in Palo alto . a gift
from sister city dentaping Sweden, it has received anything
but sisterly hospitality .
yet, as far as public outs go , it's pretty safe ; It's a
mere depiction of a boy and gul betting on a park bench
Under a Lamppost , with a dog at their feet looking
up at a bid on top of the lamppost . The Sculpture
isn't likely to drow lie from an art Critic like , for
example, Jesse Helms ,
Still some folks dislike intensely. The poor thing has
been torched, Spray painted, vandalized every which way .
Sometime ago, someone made off with the bud atop
the Camppast . Without it's feathered pal , it Seems the
dog is staring at nothing at all, Steven Stage, a
Palo alto reference librarian and historian, would like
to change that .
