Economy DOOMS P. A Housing - AID HOPES
With most of it's employees living a long commute
away, Palo alto had hoped to increase the availability
of financial assistance to more city employees could
live in this exorbitantly priced community. Those hopes,
however , have been dashed by the dismal economy .
Strapped for funds, the city has concluded it
Can afford only to offer greater housing incentives to
the top echelon at City Hall.
Currently housing assistance is available to the four
Council - appointed officers: the city clark, awditor, attorney
and manager .
But under a new proposal backed by the councils
policey committee , some new housing benefits Could be
extended selectively to all department heads and to the
assistant city manager. among the benefits that could
be made more Widely available are relocation Costs ,
Mortgage loans and rental subsidies of up to $500 a month
for 36 months.
The extended housing program probably would be
Reended by city reserves, according to a staff report.
