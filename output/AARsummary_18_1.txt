Chance of winning, but this time around Diane Rells
was the top vote-getter in the race for three seats on
the Palo alto Unified School District .
Rellis the only incumbent in the Seven-way race,
Schools activist Susan Richardson and businessman
Don Way are now the school board's newest members .
"It feels pretty super, said heller, her voice bubbling
Over with excitement. "I really feel the people are happy
with what's been accomplished is the last few years ."
The race was marked by polite campaigning and a
lack of controversies to help voters distinguish among
Candidates. Most of the contestants had senled on
school district committees and all agreed on what the
distrust should do: lower class size, renovate Campuses,
Increase parent and community involvement, teach critical
thinking skills and deal with a growing, ethnically diverse
Student body .
