FAC 104r
COMMISSION OKS PEDESTRIAN GATES
AT TRAIN INTERSECTION WHERE
GIRL DIED
In an unusual move, the state Public Utilities
Commession
espion on Wednesday unanimously approved
the installation of pedestrian crossing gates for a
Cal TRain intersection in Palo alto where an Il-year
old guil was killed last month .
In the past , mechanical aimis that block, the
Sidewalk Were considered unnecessary because arms
with flashing red lights and bells already block the
Sheet when theins are approaching, Only a handful
of pedestrian gates remain in Operation in the state.
But the commission which creates and ad ministers
Standards for railroad crossings, voted to exempt
Palo alto from a state regulation prohibiting pedestrians
gates , largely because the state we'll not have to
foot the bell for their installation .
" a major reason why this passed so smoothly is
that it's just an exemption . The state doesn't have
to pay for the project itself; said Scott Sanders ,
adviser to commission President Patricia M. Echect.
" That fact distinguishes this project from others . "
