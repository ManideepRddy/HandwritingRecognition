that the district's stoff and some Jeeus say gives a
distated view of Judaism .
The books, published by Houghton Mifflin for fourth - to
eigth-graders, were criticized in a letter by a load Jewish
group that said the texts contained misleading language
and histoucal inaccuracies that might lead students to
believe Jews are " uncaring people , lacking compassion .

deal adequately with such topics as racial diversity and
geography and they suggest teachers supplement all three
Issues with other materials .
