SKATEBOARDERS WANT TO
RUN THEIR PARK
By day, they are picture- perfect in Crisp suits
and thes . But in the off hours , they get down
and deity with thick helmets and pads .
Palo alto residents Andy Shete, Owner of a graphics
design Company; Steve Berndt, a financial andyst ; Eve
Bloom operations manager for the citys Sanitation Company's
and Jane Smith, a marketing representative for a software
Company , are avid skateboarders and have been for more
than half of their lives .
Now, this enterprising foursone of 26- year-olds is combining
business acumen and admiration of the sport to try
to help Palo alto make it's highly touted but controversial
Skateboard park safer.
These skateboarders would like to take over the
City - owned $95.DO concrete bowl, which has plagued
the city with financial and safety problems since
it opened in December 1990. They would do so by
forming a partnership of skateboarders, either profit
Private or non-profit , that would assume all aperational
Costs and liability for the Green Park skateboard boul.
