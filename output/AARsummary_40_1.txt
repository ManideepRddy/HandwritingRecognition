NOT MUSIC TO EARS SHORELINE
CONCERT DRAWS P.A COMPLAINTS
The pounding base line and piercing
ncing guitar licks
of Van Halus heavy -metal music may not be your
thing , but if you were in the north end of Palo alto
when the band played at Shoreline Amphitheater on Friday
night, you didn't really have a choice .
Dozens of people called the amphitheater and the Mantain
View and Palo alto police departments Friday night to complain
that the noise- er, music - was bouncing off the lew hanging
atmosphere and into their homes. The band's two-night
run ended Saturday.
Amphitheater officials said they kept the mouse level
at fridays concert below the 8-decible limit set
by the mountain View City council early this year.
General Manager Steve Macfadyen said the level
Measured at the top of the bowl , never exceeded 95 decibels
But on nights seven as Friday , when a layer of
Warm, Stable air hovers above the Cooler valley floor ,
the mesecians stores sound is conducted about four miles
Month into the yards of the GulQuiet Palo Alto neighborhood
never middlefield Road and Oregon Expressway
