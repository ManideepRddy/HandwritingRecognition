edge of Palo alto , has turned into the seee of a fiery
Showdown between city council members and residents.
For 26 years, Foothills Park has been the only pail in
California restricted to city residents. But for the past
year, Councilman Ron anderson has been pushing to
Open the paul to visitors from other communities . and
though he may be fighting a losing battle , andersen is
Set to guile it one last shat .
I just think that fundamentally this is a bad policy "
Undersen said, I simply there its wrong. It's been a
tough issue for me . But if it's voted down again this
time this well be the and of it , as far as I'm concerned .
On Sept. 16, council members will consider whether
to open the 1400-acre park on the eastern banta
Cruz Mountains to non-residents everyday, a Certain
number of days a year or not at cell
