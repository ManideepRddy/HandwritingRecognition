FACIOIS
HALF A CENTURY On CHRISTMAS TREE LANE
Twas two Saturdays before Christmas, and plenty
of creatures were stirring in the Oldamis family .
It was the day that the folks on Fulton Street
turned their Palo alto neighborhood into Christmas Tree
Lane. But on Saturday morning , they first gathered
at the Adams' house for coffee and doughnuts and chat .
If you're a longtime Peninsula resident , you've
probably heard about the tradition . Every year since
1940, Without fail, residents on the 1700 and 1800
blocks of Fulton decorate their front yards with
Christmas trees and nativity scenes and Santas and
angels .
and every year , people from all over the Bay
area drive down the two blocks between Embarcadero
Rd and Seale avenue, bumper to bumper with only
their pauling lights on , to check out the multitude
of lighted decorations that line the normally quiet
residential ssturt.
