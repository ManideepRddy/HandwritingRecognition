P.A TO CONSIDER ELIMINATING
DETOUR ON BICYCLE BOULEVARD
EXTENSION WOULD MEAN STRAIGHT
SHOT THROUGH Downtown
Imagine if motorist rumbling along alma Street in
a hours to get to downtown Palo alto suddenly had to
detour one block east onto Emerson Street. Sound likea
Menor inconvenience. Then suppose drivers were forced to do
that everyday .
That's exactly what commuters of the two wheled variety
face everytime they navigate the city's famed Bryant Street
bicycle boulevard .
The bicycle boulevard, which runs along a two - mile
Stretch of Bryant Street from East Meadow Drive to
Chenchill Avenue, offers no direct route for cyclists
Continuing to downtown . Instead, at Churchill avenue,
Cyclists must veer one block east to Waverely Street.
Now, nine years after completion of that stretch of
the boulevard, city staff members are recommending it
finally be extended north through downtown to the
bicycle - pedestrian bridge across San Francisquits Creek
Into Menlo Park.
