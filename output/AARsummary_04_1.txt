VACATION INITIATIVE FALLS
TO HARD TIMES
It sounded like an idea that Couldn't miss ;
Six weeks of vacation. Guaranteed, for every employee
But a campaign to secure just that right in the
Calfana Constitution flopped, falling victim to
the recession.
Palo alto attorney Richard Such's drive to get
that amendment on the June 1992 ballot ended .
Theday, when he fell for short of gathering the
necessary signatures to qualify for the election.
He needed 615, 958 signatures by the Friday deadline.
If he got more than 100100 he'd be sunpissed .
although he had 30 volunteers in cities and
towns across California, Such never got the
financial support he had hoped for from the
fraud endestry to help pay the $1200, 000 or 20
needed to print petitions and gather bignatives .
"It's hard when people are worrying about losing
their jobs to ask them to sign something like this ,
The said . " The time just wasn't right for this ."
