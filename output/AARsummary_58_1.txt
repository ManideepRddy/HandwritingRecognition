PALO ALTO'S CLINIC PROJECT
MOVES CLOSER
after four years of negotiations, the Palo alto medical
Foundation has moved another step closer to realizing
a proposed 45,000- Square-foot expansion of it's medical
Clines just south of downtown .
On Tuesday, Council members preliminarily approved zoning
Changes, a development agreement, environmental impact measures
and a site plan for the $64 million expansion project. It
we'll consolidate the clinic's maze of buildings into a 2 /4-
block area along Homer Avenue and Channing Avenue ,
between Ramona Street and Waverley Street.
On Monday, the council is expected to give final approval .
Concerned that the foundation build the best designed
Clinic possible, council members agreed to allow some beway,
But only up to a point .
Turning aside a planning Commission recommendation and
Some resident's concerns, council members voted 7 -1 to allow
the foundation to build a two-story parking garage off
of Waverly Street, if necessary , for SO parking spaces
