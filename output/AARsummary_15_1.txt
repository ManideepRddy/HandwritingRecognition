P.A PROTESTS GREET YMCA'S
EXPANSION PLAN
In a scene reminiscent of the ongoing batte over
the expansion of the downtown Palo alto Medical Clinic,
the city council held a quarrelsome thee - hour
public hearing . Tuesday night that could have been
titled " YMCA : The sequel .
Like the medical clinic , the application by the YMCA
to more than double the size of its facilities on Ross
Road in south Palo Alto pits a non-profit agency that
series a Citywide constituency against it's Immediate
neighbors .
"We had hoped to enjoy our senset years in the peace
and tranquillity of an B-I( single- family residential ) neighborhood,
Said Bob Gurney, who lives with his wife on Stone Lane
around the corner from the YMCA. " But this will not
be the case because of the increased traffic .'
jurney was among 52 people who signed up to
address the council , which adyseemed at midnight without
making a decision on the expansion plans. The Council,
Which will take up the issue again Monday , is hoping
to avoid the bitternes of the fight over the expansion of the
medical clinic which we'll be decided by voters in a referendum next July
